<p>HTML5 makes wrting in HTML a pleasure.</p>
<p>With a little help from VIM, equipped with snipMate, surround, autocomplpop,
etc., wrting in raw HTML can be very efficient.</p>
<p>Also, writing in raw HTML voids the need of thinking about what the real
structure of the document is, as with Markdown. I have a feeling I don't need
any of those extra layers anymore.</p>
<p>Basically testing site out, since I don't have jekyll locally installed.
Pushing now. See ya!</p>
